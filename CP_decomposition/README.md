## CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) Decomposition
According to the CP decomposition a tensor $X$ can be estimated by its factors as below:

$\hat{X} = \sum_r \lambda_{r} a_r^{(1)} \otimes a_r^{(2)} \otimes ... \otimes a_r^{(N)}$

where $a_r^{(n)} \in \mathbb{R}^{I_n}$ is a unit vector where $I_n$ is the size of the dimension $n$ with weight vector $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{R}$ where $R$ is the rank and $\otimes$ denotes outer product. Usually all $a_r^{(n)}$ for each mode $n$ for $n=1,2,...,N$ are collected as a matrix and called factor matrices, i.e., $A_n=\l[]$

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$
